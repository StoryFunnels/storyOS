# storyos.dev — Marketing Website Plan

> Status: **planning + foundation**. The public front door at `storyos.dev` (app is
> `app.storyos.dev`, docs are `docs.storyos.dev` — see MN-105). Build tickets:
> **MN-110 … MN-137**.

## 1. Goals & audiences

**Goal:** convert the right people to *Start free* (`app.storyos.dev`), *Self-host*
(GitHub), or *Talk to us* — and make the **agentic business OS** positioning land in 5
seconds. Secondary: rank for "open-source work OS / Notion-alternative / self-hosted
database" and be the obvious answer when someone wants AI agents on their own data.

**Audiences:**
- **The builder / ops lead** (JCM-style) — wants to model their business and stop paying
  per-seat for a closed tool.
- **The technical founder / self-hoster** — wants open source, API-first, data ownership.
- **The AI-forward operator** (marketer/agency) — wants agents running their workflows on
  structured data (the differentiator).

## 2. Tech decision

**Astro** for `storyos.dev` (marketing) + **Astro Starlight** for `docs.storyos.dev`.
Rationale: content-first, ships near-zero JS by default (Lighthouse 95+ easily),
markdown/MDX-native (docs generate straight from the repo `docs/`), islands for the few
interactive bits (view-type switcher, pricing toggle), and it deploys **independently of
the app** so it stays fast and can't break the product. Tailwind for styling with the
ported StoryOS tokens. Lives in the monorepo as **`apps/marketing`** (+ `apps/docs`).
_Fallback if we want one framework: a Next.js static-export marketing app — but Astro is
the right tool for a content site._

## 3. Design system (port from the app)

Brand tokens (from `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`) — reuse verbatim so site and app feel
like one product:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| App / page bg | `#faf7f1` (warm cream) | page background |
| Surface / card | `#ffffff` | cards, panels |
| Sidebar / muted | `#f4efe5` | alternating sections |
| Ink / primary | `#0f1729` (navy) | text, primary buttons |
| Accent | `#d4a017` (gold) | highlights, links, CTAs |
| Accent hover / soft | `#e8b830` / `#fbf3d8` | hover, tints |
| Radius | 6 / 8 / 12px | controls / cards / modals |
| Type | **Figtree** (+ system fallback) | everything |

- **Type scale**: display (hero) → h1 → h2 → h3 → body → small; generous line-height,
  tight display tracking. One font (Figtree) at multiple weights.
- **Components**: `Button` (primary navy / accent / ghost), `Container`, `Section`
  (alternating cream/white), `Nav`, `Footer`, `Card`, `Badge`, `FeatureRow`, `Stat`,
  `Tabs` (for the view switcher), `CodeBlock`, `CTA`.
- **Motion**: restrained — fade/slide on scroll, subtle hover lifts. No gratuitous parallax.
- **Dark mode**: ship both (the app is theme-aware); default follows system.
- **Imagery**: real product screenshots (the app's warm UI is the hero), plus simple
  diagrams for the agentic loop. Every image `<img>` optimized + responsive.

## 5. Home page — section order

1. **Hero** — "The agentic operating system for your business." Subhead: model your
   business in real databases; run it with AI agents. CTAs: *Start free* · *Self-host*.
   Visual: a real workspace + an agent acting in it.
2. **What it is** — databases + real relations + one dataset, many views.
3. **View-type switcher** — Table / Board / Calendar / Gallery / List / Feed / Timeline /
   Form (tabbed, screenshots).
4. **The agentic layer** ★ — MCP = the agent's hands; the workspace = its memory; the
   loop diagram; "works with Claude & ChatGPT today."
5. **Templates** — install a whole business in a click (agency, marketing, sales, …).
6. **Own your data** — open source (AGPL), self-host, API-first, no lock-in.
7. **Pricing peek** — free/self-host forever; cloud + AI tiers.
8. **Final CTA** + newsletter.

## 6. What we'll have soon (feature narrative to sell)

Ship-ready today: 8 view types, relations, lookups, rollups, formulas, buttons,
automations, comments/mentions, attachments + editor image uploads, templates/packs,
CSV import, GitHub + Linear import, PATs, **the MCP server (read+write)**, self-host.
Coming (roadmap, foreshadow honestly): **agentic workflows** (`run_agent`, agent packs —
MN-109), **hosted MCP** (MN-106), email/notifications (MN-103), more integrations
(Slack, Google Calendar, native StoryFunnels/StoryPages — MN-099), forms v2 with public
sharing/embed (MN-101), admin/billing (MN-104/107). The site sells the vision but only
*claims* what's shipped; roadmap items are clearly framed as coming.

## 7. Non-negotiables

- **Performance**: Lighthouse ≥ 95 all categories; fonts self-hosted; images responsive.
- **SEO**: per-page title/description/OG, JSON-LD, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, canonical.
- **Analytics**: privacy-first (Plausible/Umami), no cookie-wall.
- **A11y**: semantic, keyboard-navigable, contrast-checked, reduced-motion honored.
- **Responsive**: mobile-first; the view switcher and nav collapse cleanly.

## 8. Build sequence (batches → tickets)

Implement in batches; **test + critique after each ticket** (the founder's rule).
